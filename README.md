## Rock, Paper, Scissors ... any key

Welcome,

This is my second project at the code institute. The core of this project is the java script functionalization of a front-end website. For this reason I chose the game "rock, paper, scissors, spock". However I put a little twist on it and added the "any key" move. As pretty much everybody knows the phrase: "Press any key to continue."

## Design & features

The website is useable in all formats and adjusts to the screen size.

The header is made up of the primary headline of the website and the most important buttons, like play, pause, stop, ultimate anykey and a link to the rules section.

The next section holds the actual play feature.
Here you are able to write down your name and play against a computer player. Once you press the play button in the header you are able to play by clicking on the icons that just poped up. You can pause at anytime by pressing the pause button in the header. The ultimate anykey button will ramp up the stacks by allowing the pc player to not just play random but anticipate your next move by learning from your previous behaviour.
If you have played to your hearts content and want to stop, press stop in the header and the website is set back to zero. Meaning you can start fresh.

The next small section holds a small score sheet which tracks your stats while you play. It counts wins and loses as well as how many sets (3 out of 5 wins/loses) you played.

The Next section explains the rules. Here you can also change the keyboard settings for each symbol. Since the anykey button allows for keyboard use addityional to mouse clicks.

At the bottom you will also find a small footer where you can find some links to facebook, LinkedIN and Github. However, only Github actually goes further than the websites homepage.

The footer has a hidden segment where your progress is recoreded during the game in order to run all the functions with as little  global variables as possible.

## Tests

I've tested the code for html, css and javascript.
